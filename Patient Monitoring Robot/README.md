# ESP32 Health Monitoring System  
### (MAX30102 | DS18B20 | LCD | Servo Pill Dispenser | Multi-Stage State Machine)

---

## 📌 Overview

This project is a smart **health monitoring and medication dispensing system** built using an **ESP32 Microcontroller**.  

It performs the following automated health measurements:

- **Body Temperature** using DS18B20
- **Heart Rate (BPM)** using MAX30102 IR-based optical sensor
- **Blood Oxygen Saturation (SpO2%)** using the MAX30102 sensor algorithm

After measurement, the system displays a summary report on an **I2C LCD display** and supports a servo-driven **automatic pill dispensing mechanism**.

User interaction happens through a **three-button control interface** supporting:

| Button Function | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| NEXT / START | Begin or advance process |
| RESTART / CONFIRM | Reset measurement or confirm restart |
| HOLD / DISPENSE | Pause ongoing process or interact with dispenser |

A non-blocking **state machine** runs the workflow including finger detection, measurement sequencing, reporting, and restart handling.

## 📡 Sensors and Working Principles

### 1️⃣ MAX30102 (Heart Rate & SpO₂)

- Uses **optical PPG (Photoplethysmography)**.
- Emits red/IR light and measures intensity changes from blood flow.
- Detects:
  - **Heart Rate (BPM)** based on time between peaks.
  - **SpO₂** ratio using absorption differences of red vs infrared wavelengths.

📍 **Finger detection is performed using IR signal threshold** (>50,000).

### 2️⃣ DS18B20 Temperature Sensor

- Uses **1-Wire digital communication**.
- Measures temperature with **±0.5°C accuracy**.
- Reads temperature every cycle using the DallasTemperature library.

---

### 3️⃣ Servo Motor Mechanism

- Controlled through ESP32 PWM signal.
- Moves to specific angles to rotate a pill dispenser compartment.

| Compartment | Angle |
|------------|-------|
| Morning | 0° |
| Noon | 45° |
| Evening | 90° |
| Night | 135° |
| Rest Position | 180° |
